🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Decision Tree Regressor
This project performs rainfall analysis and prediction using a Decision Tree Regressor on district-wise rainfall data. It involves exploratory data visualization and machine learning to forecast annual rainfall based on district-wise features.

📁 Files
rainfall prediction.py: Main script that:

Loads and explores the rainfall dataset.

Visualizes annual rainfall per district using bar charts.

Preprocesses the data, converting categorical columns to numerical.

Trains a Decision Tree Regressor to predict annual rainfall.

Visualizes the decision tree structure.

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

📊 Dataset
Make sure to provide the CSV file district wise rainfall normal.csv in the same directory or update the file path accordingly.
